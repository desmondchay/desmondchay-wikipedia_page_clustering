The International Law Commission (ILC) is a body of experts established in 1947 by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to help develop and codify international law. It is composed of 34 individuals elected every five years by the UNGA for their "recognized competence and qualifications" in international law.  
The ILC holds annual sessions at the United Nations Office at Geneva to discuss and debate various topics in international law and to develop or codify international legal principles accordingly.
