Community property (United States) or Community of Property (South Africa) is a marital property regime under which most property acquired by a spouse during a marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse. Community property is premised on the theory that marriage creates an economic community between the spouses and that the marital property attaches to that interpersonal community, rather than to the spouses themselves..
Property owned by one spouse after the marriage is sometimes referred to as the "separate property" of that spouse. There are instances in which the community can gain an interest in inherited property and even situations in which gifts can be "transmuted" into community property. 
The community property concept originated in civil law jurisdictions but is now also found in some common law jurisdictions.
