An option contract, or simply option, is defined as "a promise which meets the requirements for the formation of a contract and limits the promisor's power to revoke an offer". An option contract is a type of contract that protects an offeree from an offeror's ability to revoke their offer to engage in a contract.
Consideration for the option contract is still required as it is still a form of contract, cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 87(1). Typically, an offeree can provide consideration for the option contract by paying money for the contract or by providing value in some other form such as by rendering other performance or forbearance. See consideration for more information.
