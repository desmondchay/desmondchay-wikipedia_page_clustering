Proportionality is a general principle in criminal law used to convey the idea that the severity of the punishment of an offender should fit the seriousness of the crime. The concept of proportionality is used as a criterion of fairness and justice in statutory interpretation processes, especially in constitutional law, as a logical method to assist in discerning the correct balance between the sanction or punishment imposed and the severity of the prohibited act. Under international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict, proportionality and distinction are important factors in assessing military necessity.
