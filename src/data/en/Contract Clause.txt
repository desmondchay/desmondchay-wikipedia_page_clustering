The Contract Clause appears in the United States Constitution, Article I, section 10, clause 1:

No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.
Although the clause recognizes people's right to form contracts, it allows the government to create laws barring contracts offending public policy, such as contracts for sex or for child labor.
The clause immediately follows Article I section 9, which prohibits the federal government from passing bills of attainder and ex post facto laws, or granting titles of nobility, adding a number of restrictions to the states.
