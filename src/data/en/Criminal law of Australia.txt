The criminal law of Australia is the body of law made, recognised and applied in Australia that relates to crime. Most criminal law is made and administered by the individual states and territories of Australia. However, a body of criminal law is also made and administered by the federal government. Criminal law may be differentiated from civil law, which in Australia relates to non-criminal law including civil wrongs, contract law, much of property law and other areas that concern the rights and duties of individuals amongst themselves.In Australia, when a criminal prosecution is commenced, the burden of proof lies with the prosecutor.  ((The general))rule is that an accused person is 'innocent until proven guilty'.  The standard of proof is 'beyond reasonable doubt' which is the highest standard in law.
