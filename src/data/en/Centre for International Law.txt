The Centre for International Law (CIL) was established in 2009 at the National University of Singapore, in response to the growing need for international law expertise and capacity building in the Asia-Pacific region.The CIL engages in research and capacity building on international law and policy. The Centre organises conferences, seminars and forums to encourage dialogue and the sharing of information on significant international law and policy issues affecting South East Asia or the Asia-Pacific region. The Centre also collaborates with a network of partner organisations in Singapore and overseas to further the development of international law and policy thought leadership in the region.
