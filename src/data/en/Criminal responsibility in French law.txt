Criminal responsibility is the obligation in French law to answer for infractions committed and to suffer the punishment provided by the legislation that governs the infraction in question.In a democracy citizens have rights but also duties: with freedom comes responsibility.
Unlike civil liability, the obligation to answer for damage one has caused, either by repairing it or paying damages and interest for it, criminal responsibility implies legal recourse for the state against a disturbance of the peace. This includes three major factors:

participation in a criminal offense
forms of criminal responsibility
exceptions to criminal responsibility.
