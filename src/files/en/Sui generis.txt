Sui generis ( SOO-ee JEN-ər-iss, Latin: [ˈsʊ.iː ˈɡɛnɛrɪs]) is a Latin phrase that means "of its/his/her/their own kind, in a class by itself", therefore "unique".A number of disciplines use the term to refer to unique entities. These include:

Biology, for species that do not fit into a genus that includes other species
Creative arts, for artistic works that go beyond conventional genre boundaries
Law, when a special and unique interpretation of a case or authority is necessary
Intellectual property rights, where there is no defining characteristic
Philosophy, to indicate an idea, an entity, or a reality that cannot be reduced to a lower concept or included in a higher concept
Politics and societal norms, as above for biological classification or where there is no real authority perceived
