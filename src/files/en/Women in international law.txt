International law is essential for understanding and protecting human rights, particularly in conflict situations and post-conflict reconstruction. Women continue to be disproportionately affected by these conflicts and are consistently overlooked in peace negotiations, despite their work on the ground in post-conflict reconstruction, aid and ceasefire negotiations. While women were technically included in the Geneva II peace talks regarding Syria, they were not present during formal negotiations. While women's formal participation in peace negotiations in Myanmar remain low, they still have an important role at the community level and have emerged as ‘front-line responders’ to the Rohingya situation.
