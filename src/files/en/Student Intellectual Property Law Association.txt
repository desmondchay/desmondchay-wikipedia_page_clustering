The Student Intellectual Property Law Association (SIPLA) is a voluntary association for law students who share an interest in intellectual property.  SIPLA chapters can typically be found at law schools that provide intellectual property curriculum.  Although there is no national SIPLA body, either self endowed or sponsored by a national association, independent student chapters have materialized due to the need to organize intellectual property related events and provide networking and learning opportunities to students.
