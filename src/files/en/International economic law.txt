"International economic law" is an increasingly seminal field of international law that involves the regulation and conduct of states, international organizations, and private firms operating in the international economic arena. As such, international economic law encompasses a broad range of disciplines touching on public international law, private international law, and domestic law applicable to international business transactions.For several decades, international economic law was most often associated with international trade, largely due to the fact that trade had developed the most mature multilateral legal institutions (e.g. the GATT and later WTO) for governing international commerce.  Today, however, a range of disciplines are routinely acknowledged as being as impactful and relevant to the field, including:

International monetary law;
International financial regulation (including banking, derivatives, insurance and securities regulation);
International development;
International labor and services law;
International investment law, including international commercial arbitration;
International intellectual property law;
International tax law;
International environmental law;
Sovereign debt and restructuring.Because of the breadth of international economic activities and transactions, international economic law is a highly interdisciplinary field of study.  Decisions in one area, such as tax or financial regulation, can impact the transmission of monetary policy, which can, in turn, impact the effectiveness or operation of a trade regime, and vice versa.  Consequently, a wide range of notable governmental and intergovernmental organizations are involved in formulating international economic law and policy.  Among the most important are:

National finance ministries, trade officials, and financial market supervisors;
Multilateral institutions including the IMF, WTO, Bank for International Settlements, IFC, World Bank, EU, ILO, United Nations, and European Commission;
“Minilateral” institutions associated with regional and bilateral trade, IP, financial regulatory accords, and other targeted diplomatic efforts.Following research popularized in the 1990s by scholars in international law, political science, international relations, and commercial law, academic institutions have become increasingly engaged in the study of the international economic law.
