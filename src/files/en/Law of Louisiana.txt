Law in the state of Louisiana is based on a more diverse set of sources than the laws of the other 49 states of the United States.  Private law—that is, substantive law between private sector parties, principally contracts and torts—has a civil law character, based on French and Spanish codes and ultimately Roman law, with some common law influences.  Louisiana's criminal law largely rests on American common law.  Louisiana's administrative law is generally similar to the administrative law of the U.S. federal government and other U.S. states.  Louisiana's procedural law is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
