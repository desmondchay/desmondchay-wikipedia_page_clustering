In academic terms, French law can be divided into two main categories: private law (Droit privé) and public law (droit public). This differs from the traditional common law concepts in which the main distinction is between criminal law and civil law.
Private law governs relationships between individuals. It includes, in particular:
Civil law (droit civil). This branch refers to the field of private law in common law systems. This branch encompasses the fields of inheritance law, civil law, family law, property law, and contract law.
Commercial law (droit commercial)
Employment law (droit du travail)Public law defines the structure and the workings of the government as well as relationships between the state and the individual. It includes, in particular:

Criminal law (droit pénal)
Administrative law (droit administratif)
Constitutional law (droit constitutionnel)Together, these two distinctions form the backbone of legal studies in France, such that it has become a classical distinction
