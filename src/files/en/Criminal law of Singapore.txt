Although the legal system of Singapore is a common law system, the criminal law of Singapore is largely statutory in nature. The general principles of criminal law, as well as the elements and penalties of general criminal offences such as assault, criminal intimidation, mischief, grievous hurt, theft, extortion, sex crimes and cheating, are set out in the Penal Code. Other serious offences are created by statutes such as the Arms Offences Act, Kidnapping Act, Misuse of Drugs Act and Vandalism Act.In addition, there is a common perception to foreigners that the Singapore society is moderately regulated through the criminalization of many activities which are considered as fairly petty or harmless in other developed countries. These include charged in state court for urinating in public, littering, jaywalking, the possession of pornography, the sale of chewing gum, and sexual activity; such as oral and anal sex between men. It has been claimed that one of the results of such robust regulations and interventions is that Singapore has one of the lowest incidences of violent crimes in the world. In 1996, the National Crime Prevention Council of Singapore started its annual publicity campaign with the anti-crime campaign tag-line "Low crime does not mean no crime".Singapore retains both corporal punishment (in the form of caning) and capital punishment (by hanging) as punishments for serious offences. For certain offences, the imposition of these penalties is mandatory. More than 400 people were executed in Singapore, mostly for drug trafficking, between 1991 and 2004. Statistically, Singapore has one of the highest execution rates in the world relative to its population, surpassing Saudi Arabia. Science fiction writer William Gibson famously described Singapore as "Disneyland with the death penalty".
