Freedom of contract is the freedom of individuals and groups to form contracts without government restrictions.  This is opposed to government regulations such as minimum-wage laws, competition laws, economic sanctions, restrictions on price fixing, or restrictions on contracting with undocumented workers.  The freedom to contract is the underpinning of laissez-faire economics and is a cornerstone of free-market libertarianism.  Through freedom of contract, individuals possess a general freedom to choose with whom to contract, whether to contract or not, and on which terms to contract.
